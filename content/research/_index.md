Most of my work is focused on issues in philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science with a focus on deep neural networks. I am interested in the kind of explanations that we might get from deep neural networks when we approach them as models of human cognition. I am also interested in how the insights into the working of deepn neural networks could constrain our theorising about the mind and its operations.
On this page, you will find some more details on my current work and links to my published materials.

## Dissertation
In my doctoral dissertation, I focus on cognitive maps and the notion of world models in general. What sort of role do they play in our theorising about the human mind? And what sort of entities must they be to play such a role?

## Representational Similarity Analysis
Recently my work has focused on how RSA helps explain informational encoding in humans and the limits of such explanations.
